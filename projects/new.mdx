Digital Consulting is an open source software written in JavaScript. The source code is
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DemocraciaEnRed/consultas-digitales).
However, the software is no longer actively maintained, and many of its dependencies are
outdated and no longer supported. As a result, it was not suitable for production use
without significant updates and modifications.

Through our consulting service, we identified the significance of the needed updates, and after dicussing
with our client, we performed the updates, and successfully deployed the software on AWS using EC2 target group instances.
In addition to that, we utilized various other services such as MongoDB for data storage and SES for
email notifications. To streamline the deployment process, we implemented GitHub Actions and Terraform,
enabling our client to easily deploy the software with minimal effort.
